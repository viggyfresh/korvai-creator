# Korvai Creator

## Development

* Requires Docker

* Modify files (i.e. `creator.py` as needed)

* When finished, from the working directory of the project, run the command `docker build -t korvai-creator .` to build a fresh Docker image with your changes. This should take a long time the first time you run the command, but will be pretty quick thereafter.

* To actually run the script, (for now) run the command `docker run korvai-creator`.
